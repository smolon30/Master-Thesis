# Master-Thesis
The thesis project is about to develop R code to perform a metagenomics and a metabolomics analysis of 24 samples of human gut microbiota, using an in-vitro model that can simulate the human gut microbiota.
There are 4 principal steps:
1. Sequencing the samples to obtain the metagenomics matrix with the bioinformatics tool QIIME2 (hard level).
2. Develop R codes using different packages to analyze the metagenomics matrix and the metabolomics matrix, representing the results throught graphics and descriptions.
3. Integrate the results of metagenomics and metabolomics throught web tools and software like cytoscape.
4. Conclusions and observations.
